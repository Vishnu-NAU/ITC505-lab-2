        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This book is intended to give an exact insight into the theory of relativity to those who take an interest in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.</p>

        <h2>The Special Theory of Relativity</h2>
        <h3>Physical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions</h3>
        <p>In your schooldays, most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of Euclidean geometry...</p>

        <h3>The Lorentz Transformation</h3>
        <p>Maxwell’s equations—which form the basis of classical electrodynamics—require the same laws of physics to be valid for all coordinate systems moving uniformly relative to one another.</p>

        <h2>The General Theory of Relativity</h2>
        <h3>Principle of Equivalence</h3>
        <p>The observer inside a closed room cannot distinguish whether the force acting upon him is due to gravitation or acceleration of the room.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The theory of relativity has profoundly changed our understanding of time and space...</p>

        <p>This HTML structure follows semantic principles. I used headings to differentiate sections, paragraphs for content, and an unordered list for the bibliography.</p>
